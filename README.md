# Huffman coding

The proposed problem essentially involves reading simple ASCII text files and compressing them into a smaller-sized file. Additionally, it involves performing the reverse operation, i.e., decompressing this file and rewriting the original file.

To accomplish this task, Huffman coding was used, which involves creating a binary tree where characters that appear more frequently in the input file have shorter binary codes, and characters that appear less frequently have longer binary codes. Figure 1 illustrates a Huffman compression tree, where the path to each character represents its binary code.
